[Joe Bailey Photography](https://joebaileyphotography.com)

I’m an 18-year-old amateur photographer currently based in **Southampton**. My family lives around **Cambridge** and I often return home to see them during the holidays. I’m studying Web Design and Development at Southampton Solent University, but have a major passion for photography.

If someone asks me what type of photographer I am, I generally tell them I take pictures of planes, cars, and wildlife. That’s generally down to circumstance. My family and I are into those type of things, and that’s where I end up going to take photos. I’m still discovering my style and have the freedom to explore. So far, I have had many opportunities to capture vehicles and planes and I apply new skills and techniques each time. I take my camera everywhere so I’ve also been photographing aspects of wildlife in the British countryside. The thing that captivates me about photography is the opportunity to always learn more, no photographer is perfect, there is always room for improvement and I am always looking to improve my photography so I can take the best photos I possibly can.

During my early life, my Mum would always take photos of me. She’d record every milestone and every day trip. I started to have turns with the camera as I grew up, eventually purchasing my own in 2013. Later, I was the one taking the camera everywhere. Then adding to my collection of lenses, flash and filters to further progress my photographic capabilities. Then I went on to specialise in the subject at Sixth Form.

Many of my photos have been featured in my local paper, The Cambridge News. My photos have also been shortlisted for two competitions, The LandLove 2017 Photography Competition, and The Herts Motor Show Classic Car Photography Competition. I have also taken photos for the Cambridge University Sports Centre, a Vintage Weigh and Pay event, and a Charity Golf event.
